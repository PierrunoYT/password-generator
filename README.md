# Password Generator
This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords with customizable length and character composition.

# Usage 
To use the password generator, run the generate_password() function in your Python environment. The program will prompt you to enter your desired password length and the number of letters, numbers, and symbols you want to include. You can choose which types of characters to include by typing "y" for yes or "n" for no.

After entering your specifications, the program will generate a random password and print it to the console.

# Depencies
The password generator requires the string and random Python libraries. These libraries should be included with most Python installations.
